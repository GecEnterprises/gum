# gum 🍬
> This project is still in experimental phase. Please use Regolith instead unless you know what you are doing/using it to experiment.

An attempt at a holistic Bedrock Behavior Pack-Resource Pack tooling.

gum tries to be a [Regolith](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith) alternative that has a different approach to how a Bedrock Add-On project is structured. 

## Experimentation list 
- Rather than using Typescript recompiling, why not just build a Tauri node-editor for it?
