# What is gum?

gum is an experimental attempt at a holistic Minecraft Bedrock Add-On tooling. gum tries to position itself as an alternative to [Regolith](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith).

## What makes gum different?

Tooling are usually created in more of a pipelined approach, where each tool performs a specific task. Regolith is a compiler that makes creating Bedrock Add-On projects more streamlined, but you are essentialy still writing definitions the way Microsoft intended it to be. gum is more holistic in a sense that it's philosophy is to abstract a lot of that process and definitions. What is usually three files in a Regolith-oriented project structure, would be a single file in gum.

## Alternative does not mean better!
gum has a risk. The Regolith approach gives you a lot more flexibility in the long run since essentially you are directly creating the behavior/resource pack definitions. gum will be more rigid, as gum is still essentially a precompiler to that BP/RP definitions, and have many abstractions that needs to be updated as time goes on.

## Try gum
Now that you know the risk of gum, you can try gum!
